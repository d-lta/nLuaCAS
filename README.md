# nLuaCAS - Symbolic Calculus Engine for TI-Nspire CX

**nLuaCAS** is a lightweight, high-performance symbolic math engine built entirely in Lua for the TI-Nspire CX and CX II calculators. It provides a rich set of calculus and algebra tools in a user-friendly, calculator-native UI.

🚧 This is a work-in-progress (WIP) project and may continue to evolve with features, refinements, and bug fixes.  
✅ Despite its lightweight design, **nLuaCAS qualifies as a functional Computer Algebra System (CAS)** — it performs symbolic manipulation including differentiation, integration, simplification, and solving, all on-device.

⚠️ This tool is for educational use only. It is not intended for exams or assessments unless explicitly permitted. Misuse may violate academic integrity policies.

## ✨ Features

- **Expression Simplification**  
  Like-term combining, power rules, expansion, and constant folding.

- **Symbolic Derivatives**  
  Supports standard, partial, higher-order, and chain rule differentiation.

- **Symbolic Integrals**  
  Indefinite and definite integrals, power rule, and common functions.

- **Equation Solving**  
  Supports linear, quadratic, and some cubic equations symbolically.

- **Pretty-Printed Output**  
  Fractions, powers, and symbols rendered in a human-friendly display.

- **History Navigation**  
  View past computations in the History tab.

- **Function Definition and Memory**  
  Define and evaluate user functions with `let f(x) = ...`.

- **Themed UI with Dark Mode**  
  Stylish, custom-themed interface that remembers your mode.

### Input Formats

| Action | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Derivative | `d/dx(x^2)` |
| Partial Derivative | `∂/∂y(x^2 + y^2)` |
| Integral | `int(x^2)` or `∫(x^2)dx` |
| Definite Integral | `int(x^2, 0, 1)` |
| Solve Equation | `solve(x^2 = 4)` |
| Simplify Expression | `x^2 + 2x + 1` |
| Function Definition | `let f(x) = x^2 + 3` |
| Function Evaluation | `f(2)` |
